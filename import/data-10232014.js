		q1: 'Before Hack Reactor I spent 10 years working in community mental health.  For the last 5+ years I specialized in working with young people with schizophrenia and I became an expert in using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with that population.  I also supervised and taught other therapists how to use CBT.  My bachelor\'s degree is in theatre and my master\'s is in counseling psychology with a specialization in drama therapy. ',
		q2: 'I grew up outside of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, but I escaped 10 years ago to live in San Francisco and haven\'t looked back once!  ',
		q3: 'My main interactions with tech are playing games.  I love puzzles and immersive environments I can interact with through my phone or tablet.  And I am always up for a game of Words with Friends or Scramble!',
		q4: 'I am totally new to coding.  I\'ve spent so much time with friends who are programmers I was kind of hoping I might learn from just being around them, but it turns out it doesn\'t work that way.  You probably already knew that which is why you are coming to Hack Reactor to get the lowdown on coding like a pro.',
